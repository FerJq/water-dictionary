            The history of books became an acknowledged academic discipline in
            the 1980s. Contributors to the discipline include specialists from
            the fields of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography,
            philology, palaeography, art history, social history and cultural
            history. Its key purpose is to demonstrate that the book as an
            object, not just the text contained within it, is a conduit of
            interaction between readers and words.
